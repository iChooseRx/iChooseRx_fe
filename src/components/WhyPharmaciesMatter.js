      <p className="mb-4">
        iChooseRx was built to help patients make conscious, informed decisions about the medications they take.
        That starts with access — and pharmacies play a vital role.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        By providing NDC-level data about your inventory, you're helping patients find the exact medications
        that align with their needs, values, or health considerations.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This data isn't just for patients. It also helps highlight your pharmacy as a trusted source for
        specific medications people are looking for — connecting you directly with an audience that
        actively wants what you carry.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        iChooseRx is about creating transparency, trust, and visibility — and we’re honored to have you as
        a part of it.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm italic mt-2">
        We never display pharmacy inventory without your participation. You’re always in control.
