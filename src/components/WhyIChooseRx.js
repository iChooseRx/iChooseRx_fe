      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why iChooseRx Exists:</h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        For the conscious consumer who <strong>wants FDA-approved medications</strong> without certain
        <strong> inactive ingredients</strong> that don’t align with their lifestyle.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        For those who <strong>need FDA-approved drugs</strong> that avoid ingredients they may be
        <strong> allergic to</strong>, or that could be <strong>counterproductive</strong> to what they’re trying to treat.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        iChooseRx empowers users to make informed decisions about what goes into their bodies. We provide
        transparency in drug data and make it easy to search for medications that align with your values,
        needs, and health goals.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We help users find and report specific NDCs available at pharmacies — and we help pharmacies thrive by
        making their inventory more discoverable.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We aim to build stronger awareness and connection between users and manufacturers who align with those choices.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>iChooseRx does not judge or discredit</strong> drugs that don’t appear in filtered results. We are not
        here to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        All users are encouraged to do their own research, check the NDC and ingredient list, and consult their
        prescribing physician and pharmacist before making decisions.
